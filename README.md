1.Basic Component Creation:

Create a new Angular component named UserComponent.
Define a template for the component that displays the user's name and email address.
Create a property in the component class to hold the user data.
Use property binding to display the user's name and email address in the template.


2.Event Binding:

Add a button to the UserComponent template labeled "Edit".
Create a method in the component class called editUser() that logs a message to the console when the button is clicked.
Use event binding to call the editUser() method when the button is clicked.


3.Two-Way Data Binding:

Add an input field to the UserComponent template labeled "Change Name".
Bind the value of the input field to a property in the component class called newName.
Display the value of newName in the template below the input field.
Implement two-way data binding so that changes to the input field are reflected in the newName property, and vice versa.

4.Styling:

Add CSS classes to the UserComponent template to style the user's name and email differently.
Define the CSS styles in the component's CSS file.

5.Add a button to the UserComponent template labeled "Toggle Details".
Use a template reference variable to reference the button element in the component class.
Implement a method in the component class called toggleDetails() that toggles the visibility of additional user details when the button is clicked.
